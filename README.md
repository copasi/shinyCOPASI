shinyCopasi - a shiny-based interface for COPASI

ShinyCOPASI allows COPASI models to be explored through a web browser. It runs on a web server and is built using the R package <em>Shiny</em>. It also uses the R package <em> CoRC</em>, which provides a high-level API for COPASI in the R language.

 <b>COPASI</b> is a simulator for biochemical networks. It is a joint project by the Hoops group ([Biocomplexity Institute of Virginia Tech] (http://www.bi.vt.edu/)), the Mendes group ([UCONN School of Medicine] (https://health.uconn.edu/quantitative-medicine/)), the Kummer, and Sahle groups ([University of Heidelberg] (http://www.bioquant.uni-heidelberg.de/research/groups/modeling_of_biological_processes.html)).
